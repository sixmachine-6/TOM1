        <h2>WELCOME TO TOM VIRTUAL LIBRARY</h2>
        <img>
        <p>The<span> TOM Virtual Lab project</span> represents a groundbreaking initiative, 
            utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application 
            dedicated to reinforcing students' comprehension of <span>displacement, velocity, 
            and acceleration analysis </span>within engineering dynamics.</p>

           <p>The web app employs <span>analytical solutions </span>as the foundation for simulations, 
            ensuring accuracy and reliability in its dynamic analyses. Although real-time 
            interaction with simulations is currently limited to sample scenarios, students 
            can customize analyses for different mechanisms<span>(RRRR, RRRP, RRRRP) </span>by inputting
             link lengths.

            <h2>RRRR</h2>
          <p>In the study of mechanisms,<span> a four-bar linkage</span>, also called a four-bar, 
            is the simplest closed-chain movable linkage. It consists of <span>four bodies</span>, 
            called bars or links, connected in a loop by<span> four joints. </span>Generally,
             the joints are configured so the links move in parallel planes, and the assembly 
             is called a planar four-bar linkage.</p>

            <h2>RRRP</h2>
            <p>It is denoted as <span>RRRP</span>,
                constructed from four links 
                connected by <span>three revolute joints 
                and one prismatic joint</span>. The slider-crank
                 linkage (RRRP) is one type of arrangement
                  such that one link is a crank, which is 
                  then <span>connected to a slider</span>by a
                   connecting rod.</p>

            <h2>RRRRP</h2>
            <p>The "rrrrp chain mechanism" is characterized by its configuration 
                of <span>four revolute pairs and one prismatic pair.</span> In this mechanism, 
                each revolute pair allows <span>rotational movement </span>around a joint, while the
                 prismatic pair permits <span>translational motion</span> along a specified axis. 
                 This combination of joints facilitates a <span>diverse range of movements</span>,
                  making the mechanism suitable for various applications such as 
                  robotic systems, mechanical linkages, or machinery.</p>
